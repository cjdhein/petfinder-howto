	<h3>Additional Information</h3>
	<hr>
	<p>As you can see above, there are a number of parameters we can include in our calls to this method allowing us to narrow our search. In fact, without using several of them at the same time, we are not likely to get very useful information.</p>
	<p> 
		Even with a narrowed search we are still likely to get several results. The <code>count</code> parameter is of particular note here since this specifies the number of results returned per call. 
	 This is used in conjunction with the <code>offset</code> parameter and the <code>lastOffset</code> tag to 'page' through results. 
	<p> Let's take a look at how this works...</p>

For obvious reasons we do not want to separate them as each might die of a broken heart after all this time.  The girls are in the Des Plaines, IL area and rather than putting them in foster care and disrupting their lives further, we are hoping to move them from their current home directly to a new home.  We do have all their vet records and as mentioned, they have been very well cared for.  Krystal, the daughter (DOB:  6-23-06) is 64 lbs so she could stand to lose some weight.  Lily (DOB:6-18-03) is 33 lbs.   The mother is not spayed and we will not spay her because of her advanced age, but we were told that she no longer cycles. Lily is spayed.  More info will be posted as we received it. Posted:  May 25, 2016."

						"$t": "This is a courtesy listing and Playing Agains Sams is absolved of any liabilities.\n\nMoose is a 1.5-2 year old husky/bully blend who was almost euthanized for space at a very high kill shelter.  He's neutered, microchipped and current on vaccinations.  He is around 40-50 pounds.  He is being fostered near Green Bay.\n\nHe would be happiest with a larger, assertive (but playful) female who will keep him in line or a female playmate who won't mind playing like a linebacker (preferably a staffy or APBT).  He submits to his foster brother (a rambunctious 80lb husky blend) because he knows he's in charge.  He seems to do best with large, confident males.\n\nHe cannot go to a home with any small animals (including dogs) because of his high prey drive.  The foster mom has been sending him to daycare during the day because of his separation anxiety, but he does great in his crate at night if the foster mom sleeps in a different room with the door closed.  He is a people pleaser when he's focused and will benefit from more obedience training and needs a confident and assertive handler.  He could easily climb fences unless they are 6 ft tall or higher (typical husky).  He has quite a bit of puppy energy left, so a home without small children is ideal because he likes to give hugs and can be somewhat mouthy. \n\nPlease contact Emily, the foster mom directly, if interested in knowing more about this beautiful and fun boy at:  emilypearsonphoto@gmail.com or call 920-604-3230. An application, reference check, homevisit and adoption fee are all required."

			As you can see in the URL, we have set the count parameter to 2, meaning we will only get two results back.</p>			
		</p>	
		<p>Likewise, the highlighted <code>lastOffset</code> tag in the result has the value of 2.</p>
		<p> <strong>Obviously, these are related, but how?</strong></p>
		If you think of all the potential results as a stack of widgets this means that:
		<ul>
			
			<li><code>count</code> is the number of widgets we are going to be looking at.</li>
			<li><code>lastOffset</code> represents the index of the last widget we are seeing in the results.</li>
			<li><code>offset</code>, if included, tells the API the index of the last widget we saw, so it will then grab the next <code>count</code> widgets and return them to us.
		</ul>
		<p> Say we wanted to grab the next 4 dogs after the two we viewed in the previous example. To do this, we would:
		<ul>
			<li>Set <code>count</code> to 4 (we want to get 4 results back)</li>
			<li>Set <code>offset</code> to 2 (since the index of the last dog we viewed was 2). This will make the API treat the dog after this as the first dog to grab.</li>

	<p>Below is a challenge for you. The sample call in the JSFiddle is pulling the first 4 dogs for the zip code 53217.</p>
	<p>Your challenge is to complete the <code>yourCall()</code> function to pull only dogs 3 and 4. Compare with the sample pull to check your work.</p>
