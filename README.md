# petfinder-howto

Simple getting started guide for using APIs, in particular the petfinder.com API.

Covers some basic API functionality and how to use the results you get back from an API to do some small activities. 

Strictly a client side setup for the examples, however I may create a full version of the pet-favoriting example and implement it via node and express at a future date.
